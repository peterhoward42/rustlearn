# This repo shows me learning Rust

I have an unusual approach:
- skim read the main learning documents - and take [notes](docs/summary-of-the-book.txt)

- write code to emphasise, correct, and reinforce the learning points
- usually as extremely minimal chunks and decoupled into one small concept as a time
- with lots of comments for narrative alongside
- usually in the forms of lots of tests
- have a quick play with some key associated topics - like consuming external packages and making a trivial web server
- a more realistic / real-world problem solving exercise (coming soon)


### Aims for the repo
- primarily to facilitate my learning
- to help others with a similar approach to learning to me, and with similar background knowledge
- as evidence of my knowledge that I can cite on my CV
